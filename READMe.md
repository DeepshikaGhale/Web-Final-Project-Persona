Persona is my final project for the Advanced Web Application Project course.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a web application called "Persona." It includes three main pages:

1. **Index**: The main page that displays a list of journal entries.
2. **Journal Details**: Displays detailed information about a selected journal entry.
3. **Post Journal**: Allows users to add new journal entries.

## Branches

There are two branches in this repository:
- `main`: Contains the full and stable code.
- `dev`: Used for ongoing development, with the latest commits.

**Note**: Development will primarily happen in the `dev` branch.

## Progress - Check-In 1

For the first check-in, the following tasks have been completed:

1. Created an MVC Web Project named "Persona" with three UI pages: Index, Journal Details, and Post Journal.
2. Implemented the `JournalModel` class as the data model for journal entries.
3. Integrated MSUnit tests for integration testing with three test methods.

## Progress - Check-In 2

For the second check-in, the following tasks have been completed:

1. Created Unit Test Project
2. Created Web API and performed CRUD in it
3. Added one test method in unit test but it does not work. I tried to test if the create method will return status code 200 when it
    //adds data to dbcontext but it does not give positive response,
    //i also tried using other methods of Assert class but it still does not work

## Progress - Check-In 3

For the third check-in, the following tasks have been completed:

1. Add test method to the Unit Test Project
2. Added identity framework partially to the project.
3. Performed CRUD from web application
4. Integrated persona Web API to the web application.
6. Added three more test method in unit test. Only two unit test works out of four unit tests. I tried to test if the get method will work but it didn't well.
