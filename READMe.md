Persona is my final project for the Advanced Web Application Project course.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a web application called "Persona." It includes three main pages:

1. **Index**: The main page that displays a list of journal entries.
2. **Journal Details**: Displays detailed information about a selected journal entry.
3. **Post Journal**: Allows users to add new journal entries.

## Branches

There are two branches in this repository:
- `main`: Contains the full and stable code.
- `dev`: Used for ongoing development, with the latest commits.

**Note**: Development will primarily happen in the `dev` branch.

## Progress - Check-In 1

For the first check-in, the following tasks have been completed:

1. Created an MVC Web Project named "Persona" with three UI pages: Index, Journal Details, and Post Journal.
2. Implemented the `JournalModel` class as the data model for journal entries.
3. Integrated MSUnit tests for integration testing with three test methods.
